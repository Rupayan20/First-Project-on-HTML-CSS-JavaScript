                <br>
                <p> Cellular networks are radio or, mobile networks that are devided into fundamental units called cells. Each cell has a functional base station which restricted power that makes it easier to reuse frequencies within different cells without interference. For example, the frequency used by a base station in a cell can be used by any other cells that are seperated by a relative distance. The celluar networks are very efficient ways of making use of scare frequencies.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Cellular or mobile networks are also the fastest growing field in tele-communications industries. The cellular radio network is the most succesful mobile communication system. It can be used to transmit both voice and data. Data transmission over a cellular network is a new service, which makes data network accessible from mobile terminals via cellular telephones. These base stations provide the cell with the network coverage which can be used for transmission of voice, data and other types of content. A cell typical uses a different set of frequencies from neighbouring cells,

                        <div class="intro-text">
                     to avoid interference and provide guaranteed service quality within each cell. When joined together, these cells provide radio coverage over a wide geography area. This enables a large number of portable transceivers (e.g. mobile phones, tablets and laptops equipped with mobile broadband modems, pagers, etc.) to communicate with each other and with fixed transceviers and telephones anywhere in the network, via base station, even if some of the transceivers are moving through more than one cell during transmission.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A cell serves a particular area and it's size based on the number of users and varies depending on the maximum number of users to be served in that particular area and the traffic. The cell size in the densely- populated areas are comparatively larger than cell clusters in rural places. The shape of a cell can be square or hexagonal,though hexagonal is most recommended for better coverage and easy mathematical calculations.

                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Cellular network is an underlying technology for mobile phones, personal communication systems, wireless networking etc. The technology is developed for mobile radio telephone to replace high power transmitter/receiver systems. Cellular network use lower power, shorter range and more transmitters for data transmission.</p>

                        <h3 class="chrctr-h1">Features of Cellular Network:</h3>
    <p>Wireless Cellular Systems solves the problem of spectral congestion and increase user capacity. The features of cellular systems are as follow-
        <br>
        1. Offer very high capacity in a limited spectrum.
        <br>
        2. Reuse of radio channel in different cells.
        <br>
        3. Enable a fixed number of channels to serve an arbitrarily large number of users by reusing the channel throughout the coverage region.
        <br>
        4. Communication is always between mobile and base station (not directly between mobiles).
        <br>
        5. Each cellular base station is not allocated a group of radio channels within a small geographic area called a cell.
        <br>
        6. Neighbouring cells are assigned different channel groups.
        <br>
        7. By limited the coverage area to within the boundary of the cell, the channel groups may be reused to cover different cells
        <br>
        8. Keep interference levels within tolerable limits.
        <br>
        9. Frequency reuse or frequency planning.
        <br>
        10. Organization of wireless Cellular Network.
        <br>
        11. Cellular network is organized into multiple low power transmitters each 100W or less.</p>

    <h3 class="chrctr-h2">Shape of Cells:</h3>
        The coverage area of cellular networks are divided into cells, each cell having its own antenna for transmitting the signals. Each cell has its own frequencies. Data communication in cellular networks is served by its base station transmitter, receiver and its control unit.

<br>
<br>
The shape of cells can be either square or hexagon-
<br>
<br>
<h4>1. Square:</h4>
A square cell has four neighbours at distance d and four at distance Root 2 d.
Better if all adjacent antennas equidistant.
Simplifies choosing and switching to new antenna.
<br>
<h4>2. Hexagon:</h4>
A hexagon cell shape is highly recommend for its easy coverage and calculations. It offers the following advantages:-
• Provide equidistant antennas.
• Distance from center to vertex equals length of side.
<br>
<br>
<h3>What are Cellular Networks?</h3> 
Cellular networks are radio or mobile networks that are divided into fundamental units called cells. Each cell has a functional base station with restricted power that makes it easier to re-use frequencies within different cells without interference. For example, the frequency used by a base station in a cell can be used by any other cells that are separated by a relative distance. The cellular networks are very efficient ways of making use of scarce frequencies.
<br>
<br>
A cell serves a particular area and its size is based on the number of users and varies depending on the maximum number of users to be served in that particular area and the traffic. The cell size in densely- populated areas are comparatively larger than cell clusters in rural places. The shape of a cell can be square or hexagonal though hexagonal is most recommended for better coverage and easy mathematical calculations.
<br>
<br>
Popular examples for cellular networks are GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication), GPRS (General Packet Radio Service), CDMA (Code Divison Multiple Access) and 3GSM.
<br>
<br>
<h3 class="chrctr-h3">Major Characteristics of Cellular Networks:</h3>
Cellular networks were developed as an alternative to high power receiver/transmitter systems, wireless networks, personal area networks.
<br>
<br>
They use short range and low power transmitters for communication.
<br>
<br>
Their communication always happens between a mobile and a base station; no direct mobile to mobile communication.
<br>
<br>
Each base station has a dedicated collection of radio channels or frequencies within a cell; a cell covers a particular geographic area.
<br>
<br>
As the coverage area is limited to a particular cell, these radio channels/frequencies can be reused between various cell. This is called a frequency reuse.
<br>
<br>
The currently deployed wireless networks such as GSM, CDMA and LTE are known as cellular networks. In cellular networks, the entire area is divided into smaller size cells to connect mobile subscribers with RF frequency to provide voice/data services. Each of these cells house one base station (i.e. BTS or eNodeB or eNB.
<br>
<br>
The base stations are interfaced together in different topologies viz. star, mesh etc. They are interfaced with MSCs, PSTN and PSDN in the backbone.
<br>
<br>
The Macrocell covers upto 20 Km where as Microcell covers upto 1 Km. The multiple subscribers can interface with single base station using multiple access techniques such as TDMA/FDMA/CDMA. Refer Cellular network basics>> and cellular communication tutorial>> for more information.
<br>   
<br>
<h3 class="chrctr-h4">Frequency Reuse:</h3>
As because only a small number of radio channel frequencies were available for mobile systems, engineers had to find a way to reuse radio channels to carry more than one conversation at a time. The solution the industry adopted was called frequency planning or frequency reuse.
<br>
<br>
Frequency reusing is the concept of using the same radio frequencies within a given area, that are separated by considerable distance, with minimum interference, to establish communication.
<br>
<br>
Cellular phone networks use cellular frequency reuse. In the cellular reuse concept, frequencies allocated the service are reused in a regular pattern of areas, called "cell", each covered by one base station.
<br>
<br>
In mobile- telephone nets these cells are usually hexagonal. To ensure that the mutual interference between users remains below a harmful level, adjacent cells use different frequencies. However in cells that are separated further away, frequencies can be reused.
<br>
<br>
<h3 class="chrctr-h5">Frequency Reuse and Its Applications:</h3>
Frequency reuse is making use of the same frequencies between various coverage areas or cells which are separated by a significant distance to prevent interference. Following are the benefits of frequency reuse in cellular networks:
<br>
1. Nearby cells can use same frequencies without interference.
<br>
2. Escaping power is limited to adjacent cells.
<br>
3. Same frequency can be used for multiple conversations.
<br>
4. Allows from ten to fifty frequencies per each cell.
<br>
<br>
<h3 class="chrctr-h6">Frequency Reuse Offers The Following Benefits:</h3>
1. Allows communications within cell on a given frequency.
<br>
2. Limits escaping power to adjacent cells.
<br>
3. Allows re-use of frequencies in nearby cells.
<br>
4. Uses same frequency for multiple conversations.
<br>
5. 10 to 50 frequencies per cell.
<br>
6. For example, when N cells are using the same number of frequencies and K be the total number of frequencies used in systems. Then each cell frequency is calculated by using the formula K/N.
<br>
7. In Advance Mobile Phone Services (AMPS) when K= 395 and N= 7, then frequencies per cell on an average will be 395/7= 56. Here, cell frequency is 56.

                <h2 class="wrkngprncple-h1">NETWORK FUNCTION:-</h2>
<br>
<h3>Need clarification on the terminology and process behind how cellular networks function?</h3>
Firstly, an electrical signal is generated by a Transmitter. The transmit Antenna will convert that signal into Electromagnetic wave (aka RF wave) which will radiate.
An RF wave then propagates (moves through matter and/or space) and is picked up by the Recieve Antenna of the Reciever which converts the RF wave back into electrical signal.

<br>
<br>
<h2 class="wrkngprncple-h2">UNDERSTANDING CELLULAR UNITS OF MEASURE:-</h2>
Electrical power is the rate at which electrical energy is converted to another form such as motion, heat, or an electromagnetic field. Electrical Power is usually expressed in Watts (W). Watts are often cumbersome in dealing with communications systems because of the large range required. A transmitter might have 20 watts of power, while a reciever might see signals that are 0.000,000,000,000,001 watts.
<br>
<br>
For this reason the unit of measure in communication systems is the Decibel or dB. It is the smallest difference that a human ear can detect between two different sounds. Since the ear's sensitivity follows a logarithmic rather than a linear scale, the decibel (dB) has become a unit of measure of this change. The decibel has no actual numeric value, but is used to express a ratio between two powers.
<br>
<br>
<h2 class="wrkngprncple-h3">UNDERSTANDING UPLINK AND DOWNLINK:-</h2>
The uplink path is the path from the subscriber unit (mobile) to the base station and the downlink path is the path from the base station to the mobile.
<br>
<br>
One of the key elements of any radio communications system is the way in which radio communications are maintained in both of these directions. Terms including simplex, duplex, Frequency Division Duplex (FDD), and the Time Division Duplex (TDD), are all methods that can be used.
<br>
<br>
<h2 class="wrkngprncple-h4">THE PROGRESSION OF CELLULAR NETWORK TECHNOLOGY:-</h2>
There is a constant evaluation within the wireless industry in an attempt to increase transmission rates. The methods used to achieve this include:
<br>
increasing the amount of frequencies available
<br>
improving the access scheme which increases the ability to re-use frequencies
<br>
improving the modulation schemes used which increases the amount of information passed for the amount of energy spent
<br>
increasing the re-use of the spectrum
<br>
<br>
In any cellular network system or cellular technology, it is necessary to have a scheme that enables several multiple users to gain access to it and use it simultaneously. As cellular technology has progressed different multiple access schemes have been used. They form the very core of the way in which the radio technology of the cellular system works.
<br>
<br>
There are four main multiple access schemes that are used in cellular network systems ranging from the very first analogue cellular technologies to those cellular technologies that are being developed for use in the future. The multiple access schemes are known as FDMA, TDMA, CDMA and OFDMA.
<br>
<br>
FDMA- Frequency Division Multiple Access
<br>
TDMA- Time Division Multiple Access
<br>
CDMA- Code Divison Multiple Access
<br>
OFDMA- Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access
<br>
<br>
There's one last type of wireless network we need to discuss, and it's one with which you're probably intimately and constantly familiar. I'm talking about the ubiquitous wireless network employed by the humble cell phone- or, more common today, the high-tech cellular data network used by iphones and other smart phones to connect not only to each other, but also to the Internet.
<br>
<br>
<h2 class="wrkngprncple-h5">UNDERSTANDING CELLULAR PHONE TECHNOLOGY:-</h2>
Cellular phone work much the same way as do the other wireless devices we've been discussing. Signals carrying voice, text, and digital data are transmitted via radio waves from one device to another. In case of cellular networks, the data is transmitted not to a central hub in a small network of devices (as it is with Wi-Fi) or even directly from device to device (as it is with Bluetooth), but through a global network of transmitters and receivers.

        <img src="../images/wrkng-3.jpeg"  class="img3-wrkngprncple">
        <h2 class="wrkngprncple-h6">CELLS IN A NETWORK:-</h2>
        <p>What's increasing about mobile phone networks is their cellular design. (Hence the terms "cellular network" and "cellular phone.") By that, I mean that a mobile phone network is divided into thousands of overlapping geographic areas or cells. A typically cellular network can be envisioned as a mesh of hexagonal cells, as shown in Figure, each with its own base station at the center. The cells slightly overlap at overlap at the edges to ensure that users always remain within range of a base station. (you don't want a dropped call when you're driving between base stations.)</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        The base station at the center of each group cells functions as the hub for those cells- not of the entire network, but of that individual piece of the network. RF signals are transmitted by an individual phone and recieved by the base station, where they are then re-transmitted from the base station to another mobile phone. Transmitting and receiving are done over two slightly different frequencies.
        <br>
        <br>
        Base station are connected to one another via central switching centers which track calls and transfer them from one base station to another as callers move between cells; the handoff is (ideally) seamless and unnoticeable. Each base station is also connected to the main telephone network, and can thus relay mobile calls to landline phones.
    </div>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<h2 class="wrkngprncple-h7">CARRYING A TWO-WAY RADIO:-</h2>
<p>All this transmission within a cellular network originates with the handheld cell phone. A mobile phone is actually a two-way radio, containing both a low-power transmitter (to transmit data) and a reciever (to receive data).
    <br>
    <br>
    When I say low power, I mean low power-really low power. The typical cell phone includes a dual strength transmitter, capable of transmitting either 0.6-watt or 3-watt signals. In comparison, a larger than AM radio station will typically broadcast a 50,000-watt signal; even smaller AM stations broadcast 5,000-watt signals. A cell phone's 3-watt signal is puny in comparison.
    <br>
    <br>
    The reason mobile phones can get by with such low-power transmitters is that they're transmitting within a relatively limited range- within the current network cell; this way, the same broadcast frequencies can be used by multiple cells without danger of interference.
    <br>
    <br>
<h2 class="wrkngprncple-h8">THE PROTOCOLS USED:-</h2>
<p>Communication networks make use of protocols to facilitate communication between different entities within a network. A communication protocol is a set of messages and rules according to which messages are communicated between two or more entities on a network. A network entity usually makes use of a whole set of such protocols, which are organised into a layered stack. Each of the GSM entities mentioned in the previous section has such a protocol stack.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2 class="wrkngprncple-h9">GSM NETWORK:-</h2>
<p>The stacks are implemented in either hardware or software, depending on the nature of the entity it resides on. In order for different protocol developers to write interoperable code, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) has produced a set of specifications to follow when implementing GSM protocols. The specifications are such that different implementations of protocols can interoperate because of standard interfaces between protocols.</p> 
    <br>
    <br>
    A detailed description of each of the GSM protocols is not given here as it covers too much material for a short article. The interested reader is referred to for more details. A general overview of the more important protocols within the protocol stacks follows to give an idea of how the stacks are composed. The networking concepts mentioned, such as the OSI reference model, can be looked up in any good networks textbook.
<div class="texttt-wrkngprncple">
    <div class="description-2">
        <img src="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Umberto_Petrillo/publication/262105075/figure/download/fig1/AS:296839409618944@1447783438323/Structure-of-a-GSM-Network.png" class="img3-wrkngprncple">
        <p>The GSM protocol stacks correspond to that of the OSI reference model in that layers 1 and 2 correspond to the physical and link layers as defined by the OSI model. The physical layer specifies how data is transmitted from one entity to another across the physical transport medium. The physical transport medium between the MS and BTS is the either (air). Data is transmitted across the either by modulating electromagnetic radio waves. A TDMA based protocol is used to multiplex data onto the shared medium. An explanation of what has just been glanced over will be discussed in the next section- Radio Link Overview.</p>
   <br>
   <br>
   The physical medium between the BSC and the MSC is the either a landline or microwave based E1 trunk, and the protocol used is the MTP level 1 protocol of the SS7 protocol suite.
   <br>
   <br>
   The link layer provides a link between the networking layers above it, and the physical layer below it. It provides error detection and correction of packets recieved from the physical layer. A modified LAPD protocol, called LAPDm, is used over the Um interface. The MTP level 2 protocol of the SS7 protocol suite is used over the A-interface.
   <br>
   <br>
   The similarity between the GSM protocol stacks and the OSI model ends at the link layer. Layer 3 of the GSM protocol stacks does not correspond to the network layer of the OSI model. GSM's layer 3 is composed of 3 parts which is known as the message or signalling layer. It is used to set up and maintain voice circuits between users of a mobile cellular network. It does this by managing radio resources, information about user whereabouts, and voice circuit information. These operations are all specific to cellular radio networks, because other network don't have to keep track of users whereabouts or movement of users from one cell to another. The details of the layer 3 protocol span many ETSI specifications, of which the longest one is the MAP specification which spans more than 700 pages. The three sublayers of layer 3 are-
 <br>
1. Radio Resource management layer- RR
<br>
2. Mobility Management layer- MM
<br>
3. Communication Management- CM
<br>
<br>
<br>
Seeing that the operation of these three layers provides insight into the operation of a GSM network, they are discussed next.
<br>
<br>
<h3 class="wrkngprncple-h10">1. Radio Resource Management:-</h3> 
The radio link betsveen the MS and the BTS over the Um inierface is what makes mobile physically connected to a communication network to gain access it. Communication over the ether however has its drawback. The radio spectrum available for cellular communication purpose is limited. The available radio spectrum therefore has to be used efficiently. The cellular configuration of the network is designed with this aim in mind, as explained in the existing mobile communication section. It is the job of the radio resource management protocol to make use of this configuration to manage radio resources as efficiently as possible. It does this by taking care of the following responsibilities-
    1. The setup and maintenance of voice calls.
    <br>
    2. The control of handover of a call from one cell to another.
    <br>
    <br>
    The setup of calls is done by means of a polling scheme. The protocol uses a control channel which exists permanently between mobile stations and base stations. Request for call setup is sent by base stations to mobile stations on this channel. The mobilc station continually polls
    the channel for connection requests. If the mobile station and the necessary radio resources (available communication channel) are available, the protocol sets up a dedicated voice circuit. By using this scheme voice crcuits only exist when necessary, and then get destroyed. The
    control channel uses a minimal amount of radio frequency, and therefore frequency is
    conserved by minimizing the existence of voice circuits to the times when they are needed.
    <br>
    <br>
    Once a voice cireuit is created, it needs to be managed. Mobile stations move from one cell to
    another. When this happens whilst a call is in progress, the voice circuit sometimes needs to be
    transferred from one base station to another (when the cell it moves to is not served by the same base station as the one it came from). The MSC and mobile station use the
    radio resource management layer to coordinate this procedure. The procedure is called
    handover or handoff and is quite a complicated procedure.

<h3 class="wrkngprncple-h11">2. Mobility Management:-</h3>
It is necessary for the network to know where every registered mobile station is within the network in order to connect to it on reques. The management of mobie station location information is handled by the mobility management scheme. The scheme operates by means of mobile stations registering themselves with the BSC in whose area they currently are. A centralized database then stores a list of all the mobile stations in the network, and the BSC's they are currently registered with. A distributed database system is used to keep the database at the BSC and the centralized one at the server provider's premises synchronized.
<br>
<br>
Illustrates how the scheme works. A mobile Station (little car) arrives in a cell served by some BSC. It sends a message identitying itself to the BSC. The BSC sends this message to the
MSC which enters the identity of the mobile station in its visiting location register (VLR). The
MSC then notifies the server on the service providers premises that it must update the home locatien register (HLR) with the new information about the mobile station's location.
<br>
<br>
The mobility management scheme therefore consists of a distributed database (the VLR and HLR), and an associated protocol (the MM part of layer 3) to maintain location intormation of all the mobile stations on a network.
<br>
<br>
Using this scheme, a query to the centralized HLR is all that is necessary to find the current
location of a mobile station. In order to keep the HLR current, a considerable amount of
information is transmitted across the network. The HLR is updated every time a mobile station
moves from one BSC's area into another. As the number of subscribers on the network increases, the information flow because of updates to the HLR increases exponentially.
<br>
<br>
Mobility management also concerns itself with the authentication of mobile stations to the network. Mobile stations entering an MSC's area must be authenticated before they can make use of the network's resources. This ensures that only valid eustomers make use of the network.
<br>
<br>
<h3 class="wrkngprncple-h12">3. Communication Management:-</h3>
The communication management (CM) protocol of layer 3 is concerned with the setting up of calls. The call setup procedure was explaincd in the How Does it Work? section. Apart from these procedures the CM protocol also handles procedures to facilitate roaming on cellular
networks. Roaming is a service which enables customers of a particular network operator to make calls from areas not served by that network operator. The netvwork operator within the area the call is placed from, contacts a Gateway MSC (GMSC) which links the user to its own nerwork operator.
<br>
<br>
The GMSC identifies a caller's network operator by looking it up in a table. It makes use of a mobile station ISDN number (MISDN), which uniquely identifies a mobile station. The
MISDN is passed to the GMSC by the caller when requesting a call to be set up. It consists of a country code (CC), national desination code (NDC) and a subscriber number (SN). After having identified the caller's network operailor, the network operator's HLR is queried to establish the location of the called mobile station. The
call is then set up in the normal fashion.
<br>
<br>
<h2 class="wrkngprncple-h13">RADIO LINK OVERVIEW:-</h2>
As mentioned in The Protocols Used section, the physical layer between the mobile station and the BST uses radio waves to transmit data, and is therefore called the radio link. In order to transmit speech across the radio link, the original analog representation of specch is changed into a digital representation. This is done by means of using a speech coder. The speech
encoding scheme which is used by GSM is called the regular pulse excited, Iinear predictive coder (RPE-LPC) encoding scheme.
<br>
<br>
This particular encoding scheme can encode specch into digital format efficiently enough to facilitate good specch quality on transmission channels with data rates of 13.4 kbps. GSM user channels have a capacity of 33.854 kbps for every user. After overhead is added to the RPE-LPC frames, user data is transmitted at a rate of 24.7 kbps which is well within the limits of the channel capacity of 33.854 kbps. GSM systems operate in a discontinuous transmission
mode, which means that no data is transmitted during a user's silent periods. Since each person on average speaks no more than 40% ot the time, this scheme enables RPE-LPC to be used
even more effectively. The well known pulse code modulation (PCM) encoding scheme
used in most public switched telephone networks (PSTN's) is not used in GSM as it outputs
data at a rate of 64 kbps which is too expensive for GSM.
<br>
<br>
After speech is encoded, it is transmitted across the radio link by means of a digital modulation scheme. Modulation is the process by which information is encoded into a form suitable for transmission over a specific medium, which in our case is the ether. The modulation
scheme used by GSM is called 0.3 GMSK (Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying).
<br>
<br>
The radio link has a limited amount of radio frequency to use for the transmission of data. The
radio frequency available to network operators have been assigned to them by the ITU World
Radio Conference in 1995. Cellular networks were allocated approximately 50MHz
(2*25MHz bands) of radio spectrum.
<br>
<br>
It therefore makes sense to use available frequency as efficiently as possible. GSM makes use of a TDMA/ FDMA multiple access scheme to facilitate the efficient use of frequeney.
Frequency division multiple access (FDMA) is used to divide the allocated frequency up into smaller frequency bands, each used by different communicating partners. These bands are called carrier frequencies in GSM, and the two 25MHz bands (forward and reverse links) are each divided up into 124 such carrier frequencies. Carrier frequencies are allocated to base stations, making sure that interference does not occur by the same frequencies being allocated to base stations in close proximity to one another.
<br>
<br>
Time division multiple access (TDMA) is used to divide each of the carrier frequencies into communication channels. Each carrier frequency is divided into eight communication channels by means of TDMA. This means that there are 992 (124*8) traffic channels available on both the forward and reverse links. TDMA achieves the division of a carrier frequency into eight channels by dividing it into sequential time slots. Each user is allocated a unique time slot during the duration of a call. Data frames from different users are transmitted in their respective time slots and then reassembled at the receiver.

        <h1 class="text-architecture">CELLULAR SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE:-</h1>
       <div class="architecture-text">
        A cell phone is nothing more than a radio. It is a complex radio, but still a radio. In order to really understand the way cell phone works, we must discuss some of the cell phones history for just a moment.
    <br>
    <br>
    Back around the early 1950's, mobile-radio-phones were about as common as cruise control in post- World War II cars.
<br>
<br>
In select urban areas, there were large, central antennas that were specifically allocated for these radio-phones. Each car that had a radio-phone required a big antenna that could transmit at least 40 or 50 miles. Since radio technology itself was only in the building phase, only about 25 channels were available for private use. So basically only 25 people could be talking on their radio-phones at the same time.
<br>
<br>
The solution to this problem was to divide each city up into small divisions, or "cells". The technology behind cells have changed dramatically over the years, just as cell phones have, but now most standard cells are about 10 square miles large. They are usually in the shape of a hexagon. Nowadays, every individual cell has its own base station, rather than only one for an entire city.
<br>
<br>
And now cell phones are made to be low-power transmitters (either 0.3 watts or 6 watts), which is much lower wattage than in past decades. This means that the same frequency can be used in the same city, at the same time, but in different cells.
<br>
<br>
Not much has changed since the basic cellular infrastructure/ architecture remain the same. It is essentially a the areas which is divided into cells, services and connected to each other by collection of transceivers, controllers, switches, routers and resisters. Some of the main components and how it works us provided below:
<br>

<h2 class="architecture-h1">BASE TRANSCEIVER STATION (BTS):-</h2>
<p>It is actually the antenna that you see installed on top of the tower. The BTS is the Mobile Phone's access point to the network. It is responsible for carrying out radio communications between the network and the Mobile Phone. It handles speech encoding, encryption, multiplexing (TDMA), and modulation/demodulation of the radio signals. One BTS usually covers a single 120 degree sector of an area. Usually a tower with 3 BTSs will accommodate all 360 degrees around the tower. However, depending on geography and user demand of an area, a cell may be divided up into one or two sectors, or a cell may be serviced by several BTSs with redundant sector coverage. A BTS is assigned a Cell Identity. The cell identity denotes a particular Location Area, which provides details of the cells which the BTS is covering.</p>
</div>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<h2 class="architecture-h2">MOBILE EQUIPMENT (ME):-</h2>
This refers to the physical itself. The phone must be able to operate on a cellular network. Older phones operated on a single band only. Newer phones are dual-band, triple-band, and even quad-band capable. A quad-band phone has the technical capability to operate on any network worldwide.
<br>
<br>
Each phone is uniquely identified by the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number. This number is burned into the phone by the manufacturer. The IMEI can usually be found by removing the battery of the phone and reading the panel in the battery well.
<br>
<br>
<h2 class="architecture-h3">WHAT IS A CELL:-</h2>
A base station (transmitter) having a number of RF channels is called a cell. The term cellular comes irom the honeycomb shape of the areas into which are coverage region is divided. Each cell covers a limited number of mobile subscribers within the cell
boundaries (Coverage area). It cell size varies depending on the landscape. Because of constraints imposed by natural terrain and man-made structures, the true shapes of cells is not perfect hexagon. Approximately a Cell Radius is 30 Km, (Start up), 1 KM (Mature).
<br>
<br>
<h2 class="architecture-h4">CELL SIZE AND CAPACITY:-</h2>
Cell size determines number of cells available to cover geographic
area and (with frequency reuse) the total capacity available to all users. Capacity within cell limited by available bandwidth and operational requirements. Each network operator has to size cells to handle expected trafic demand.

<br>
<h2 class="architecture-h6">CELL SPLITTING:-</h2>
<p>Unlortunately, economic considerations made the concept of creating full systems with many small areas impractical. To overcome this difticulty, system operators developed the idea of cell splitting. As a service area becomes full of users, this approach is used to split a single area into smaller ones. In this way, urban centers can be split into as many areas as necessary to provide acceptable service levels in heavy-traffic regions, while larger, less expensive cells can be used to cover remote rural religion.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2 class="architecture-h7">BASE STATION CONTROLLER (BSC):-</h2>
<p>The BSC controls multiple BTSs. It handles allocation of radio channels, frequency administration, power and signal measurements from the MS, and handovers from one BTS to another (if both BTSs are controlled by the same BSC). A BSC also functions as a "funneler". It reduces the number of connections to the Mobile Switchng Center (MSC) and allows for higher capacity connections to the MSC. A BSC may be collocated with a BTS or it may be geographically separate. It may even be collocated with the Mobile Switching Center (MSC).</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2 class="architecture-h8">MOBILE SWITCHING CENTER (MSC):-</h2>
<p>The MSC is the heart of the GSM network. It handles call routing, call setup, and basic switching functions. An MSC handles multiple BSCs and also interfaces with other MSC's and registers. It also handles inter-BSC handoffs as well as coordinates with other MSC's for inter-MSC handoffs.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2 class="architecture-h9">HANDOFF:-</h2>
<p>The final obstacle in the development of the cellular network involved the problem created when a mobile subscriber traveled from one cell to another during a cell. As adjacent areas do not use the same radio channels, a call must either be dropped or transterred from one radiochannel to another when a user crosses the line between adjacent cells. Because dropping the call is unacceptable, the process of handoff was created. Handoff occurs when the mobile telephone network automatically transters a call from radio channel to radio channel as a mobile crosses adjacent cells.</p>

    <h1 class="text-fscope">FUTURE SCOPE:-</h1>
    We have listened the history and present situations of cellular network. And we understood through this, that cellular network is the fastest developing industry and India is the fastest growing country. The future of mobile network is very bright. The rise of internet users India is about to grow 40% in 2023. Mobile Networks continue to evolve wIth higher speeds, new functionality and increased population coverage. With expanding LTE coverage and subscriber count the demand for enhanced app coverage continues to accelerate the development of LTE data rates. LTE networks and devices supporting downlink data speea
    upto 1Gbps are now commercially available and launches are expected in coming months. This represent more than a six fold increase in speed since LTE's introductio.
    <br>
    <br>
    Peak data specd of 1Gbps will provide users with significantly faster time to content and will enhance the usefulness of personal hotspot, as well as making LTE a more attractive alternative to deliver fixed wireless services.
    <br>
    <br>
    VoLTE technology enables operators to offer high quality simultaneous communication and LTE data services on smart phone and other devices. 3GPP standardized Enhanced Voices Service (EVS) for VoLTE enable network further improve quality compared to HD voice. The first commercial rollout of EVS has recently started in Asia Pacific, North America and Europe. EVS provides better quality service than HD voice in challenging LTE radio condition, as well as better service robustness when using wifi-calling. With wifi-calling, operators can extend their voice service indoors, allowing customers to make their calls in their homes over their owm wi-fi access points, using any internet service provider. Support for wifi-calling is rapidly extending from high end smart phone models to more atfordable models. Some operators have also launched wifi-calling on devices without SIM card, such as tablets, smart watches and PC.
    <br>
    <br>
    ViLTE stands for Video over LTE. It is an extension of VoLTE, which enhances voice services with a high quality channel. In order to ViLTE, Voice over LTE (VoLTE) is required. Both ends users and those in the mobile industry will benefit from ViLTE.
    <br>
    <br>
    Li-Fi is Wireless communication technology, which utilizes light to transmit data and position between devices. In technical terms, Li-Fi is a light communication system that is capable transmitting data at high speed over the visible light, ultraviolet and infrared spectrum. In its
    present state, only LED lamps can be used for the transmission of visible light.
    <br>
    <br>
    5G is the most anticipated advancement in the ICT industry. The introduction of 5G will accelerate transtormation in many industry verticals, enabling new use cases areas, such as automation IoT and big data. In 2015, development of Network Functions Virtualization (NFV)
    in core network began. The first example of service deployed with NFV was VoLTE, wifi-calling. It is also a key building block on the path of future 5G development. 5G speed is up to 300 Mbps, which is set to be as much as 100 times faster than 4G. South Korea is the first country to launch 5G.
    <br>
    <br>
    Thus mobile network will come with 6th generation, 7th generation and so on.
